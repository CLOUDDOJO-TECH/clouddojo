## Key Success Strategies

### 1. Active Learning, Not Passive Watching

❌ **Don't**: Just watch videos without doing anything
✅ **Do**: Pause videos and try concepts in AWS console

### 2. Practice Questions Are Critical

**Rule**: For every 1 hour of video, do 30 minutes of practice questions.

Why? Because:
- Questions teach you HOW the exam tests concepts
- You learn to eliminate wrong answers
- You identify gaps in knowledge faster

### 3. Learn Why Wrong Answers Are Wrong

Don't just memorize correct answers. Understand:
- Why is A correct?
- Why are B, C, D wrong?
- What makes them wrong?

CloudDojo's AI explanations are perfect for this!

### 4. Hands-On is Non-Negotiable

**You MUST use AWS console.** Reading about S3 vs actually creating buckets is completely different.

Spend at least 20-30% of study time in AWS.

### 5. Sleep & Health Matter

- Get 7-8 hours of sleep
- Exercise (even 20 minutes of walking helps memory)
- Eat healthy (brain food!)
- Stay hydrated

**Tired brain = Failed exam**

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Only Watching Videos

**Problem**: You'll recognize concepts but can't apply them.
**Solution**: Do hands-on labs and practice questions.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping Weak Areas

**Problem**: Exam will test what you don't know.
**Solution**: Spend MORE time on weak topics, not less.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Reviewing Correct Answers

**Problem**: You might've guessed correctly.
**Solution**: Read explanations for ALL questions.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Cramming the Night Before

**Problem**: You'll be exhausted during the exam.
**Solution**: Rest the day before.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Simulating Exam Conditions

**Problem**: You'll struggle with time management.
**Solution**: Take full 65-question practice exams under timed conditions.

### ❌ Mistake 6: Giving Up After Bad Practice Scores

**Problem**: You quit before improvement happens.
**Solution**: Bad scores show you what to study. Keep going!

**Question Strategy:**
- Read carefully (watch for "NOT", "EXCEPT", "LEAST")
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Look for keywords:
  - "Most cost-effective" → Favor cheaper options (S3 over EBS, Lambda over EC2)
  - "Least operational overhead" → Favor managed services
  - "Most secure" → Multiple layers, encryption, least privilege

Yes, if you can dedicate 2-4 hours daily. I did it, and so have hundreds of others. It's intense but doable.

### What if I have no AWS experience?

This plan assumes basic AWS knowledge. Complete beginners should do Cloud Practitioner first or extend this to 60-90 days.

### Is CloudDojo enough, or do I need other resources?

CloudDojo + one video course + AWS free tier is enough for most people. You don't need to buy everything!

### What score should I aim for on practice exams?

- Week 1: 60%+
- Week 2: 70%+
- Week 3: 75%+
- Week 4: 80-85%+
- Exam day: 72% to pass (aim for 75%+)

### What if I can only study 1 hour per day?

Extend the plan to 60-90 days. Quality matters more than speed.
