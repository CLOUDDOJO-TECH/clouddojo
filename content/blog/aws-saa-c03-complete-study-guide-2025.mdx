- Flag difficult questions and return later
- Aim to complete first pass in 90 minutes

**Strategy:**
- Read questions carefully (watch for "NOT" or "EXCEPT")
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Look for key phrases: "most cost-effective," "most secure," "least operational overhead"
- When in doubt, choose AWS managed services over self-managed
- Don't change answers unless you're confident you misread

**Common Exam Tricks:**
- Both answers might work, but one is "better" based on the scenario
- Watch for multi-AZ vs multi-region requirements
- Cost optimization often favors serverless/managed services
- Security questions often have multiple correct layers
